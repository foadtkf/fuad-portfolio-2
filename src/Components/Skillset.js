      <p>I specialize in building complex web applications, leading front-end teams, digital product design and developing visual design systems. I enjoy creating effortless user experience and designing delightful digital products. The entire process of going from a concept to release and gathering user’s feedback on either client’s or my own products is what makes me wake up everyday!
I worked with numerous clients from all around the world from early startups to well-established companies. I always seek new opportunities for cooperation on projects around interesting dashboards, design systems or landing pages. Let’s create something awesome together!</p>
